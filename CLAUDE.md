# pi-project-workflows

Typed, multi-step workflow execution via `.workflow.yaml` specs. Schema-driven project state via pi-context. Behavior monitors that classify agent activity and steer corrections.

Monorepo: npm packages under `packages/*` with lockstep versioning. `ls -d packages/*/` for the set; each `packages/<name>/package.json` `description` + `src/index.ts` re-exports (root for pi-behavior-monitors) for its surface. `pi-project-workflows` is the meta-package re-exporting the Pi extensions; `pi-jit-agents` is a library, not an extension.

# How to establish exact current context for this project using pi-context

Read `packages/pi-context/skills/pi-context/SKILL.md` — the generated reference for the full pi-context tool + command surface - to establish understanding of pi-context.

Run  
`npx tsx -e "import {listSubstrates} from '@davidorex/pi-context'; console.log(listSubstrates('.'))"` to see the list of available context substrates.

The currently-active substrate is whatever `.pi-context.json`'s `contextDir` field names (the active-substrate pointer) — read it to establish which substrate is active. Do NOT assume the active substrate; confirm the resolved `contextDir` with the user before any read or write. Derive current project state (position, open work, recent history) from the active substrate itself — `contextState('.')` / `/context status` (below) plus `git log` — never from a stored narrative.

Substrates can be switched (like switching git branches). Switching flips the active-substrate pointer in `.pi-context.json`; subsequent reads/writes target the newly-active substrate. Switch via the gated `context-switch` op (never the raw `flipBootstrapPointer` library call — the op routes through the seeded ceremony path):

```bash
pi-context context-switch --target_dir <target-substrate-dir> --writer '{"kind":"human","user":"davidryan@gmail.com"}' --json
```

Replace `<target-substrate-dir>` with the substrate to activate (from the `listSubstrates` output above), e.g. `.context` or `.context-jit-spec-v2`. Default mode flips to an existing substrate (requires its `config.json` present); `--create_new true` bootstraps a fresh substrate at `--target_dir` AND flips in one operation; `--to_previous true` flips back to the pointer's `previous_contextDir` (`--target_dir` ignored). The op is auth-gated; the `--writer` identity is stamped on the switch.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build              # tsc compiles each package to dist/
npm test                   # all packages; must stay at 0 failures
npm run check              # biome + tsc --noEmit (also runs as husky pre-commit + npm test)
npm run format             # biome format
npm run skills             # regen SKILL.md from built extensions (run after build)
npm run promote:cli        # install/refresh the operator pi-context binary (see below)
npm run release:patch|minor|major   # lockstep bump + commit + tag
```

The operator `pi-context` CLI you dogfood with IS this working tree's code, installed by `npm run promote:cli` (`scripts/promote-cli.mjs`) as a publish-free packed COPY into the global npm prefix — NOT an `npm link` into the repo (which a `npm run build`'s `rm -rf dist` would clobber) and NOT the published registry release (stale). After editing/building pi-context, re-run `npm run promote:cli` to refresh the operator; a `release:*` run promotes automatically as its final step. Details: `packages/pi-context-cli/README.md`.

Derive context state at any time. `contextState('.')` reads the currently-active substrate (whichever `.pi-context.json` points at). To inspect a different substrate, switch to it first (see switch command above), then run:
```bash
npx tsx -e "import {contextState} from '@davidorex/pi-context/context-sdk'; console.log(JSON.stringify(contextState('.'), null, 2))"
```

Project substrate to interactive HTML view (Pattern B build-step generation; static-baked output is self-contained + offline-portable + git-trackable):
```bash
npx tsx scripts/orchestrator/build-html-views.ts          # writes html-views/substrate-overview.html
npx tsx scripts/orchestrator/build-html-views.ts --dry-run # validate substrate readability + report stats
```

Re-run after any active-substrate `*.json` change to refresh the rendered view.

## Current status — derive it, never cache it

This file records NO project status. Position, focus, open work, counts, arc narrative, what-shipped, install state, and validation all go stale the moment they are written and are never stored here. Derive them from the active substrate every session:

- **Install state** (a fresh checkout can be `not-installed`, with declared blocks/schemas missing): `pi-context context-bootstrap-state`.
- **Position / focus / ready / blocked / open work**: `pi-context context-status` (or `context-current-state`).
- **Integrity**: `pi-context context-validate` and `pi-context context-validate-relations`.
- **History / branch / what shipped**: `git log`, `git status`.

Anything that must persist beyond a session is filed in the substrate (gaps / tasks / decisions / verifications / research) and read there — not cached in this file. Releases are HELD: no `release:*` and no push/publish without explicit per-release authorization.

**Verify, don't narrate (binding).** Never assert any substrate / project / file / code-behavior fact from working memory or recollection — read it from its source (the relevant `pi-context` CLI op, `git`, the actual file) at the moment you claim it, and report what the read returns, not what you remember. After any substrate write, read it back and confirm it reconstructs what you intended. State recalled across turns or a context compaction is stale by default; a remembered claim is not a verified one. This is the read-don't-recall complement to derive-don't-cache above.

## Conventions

- ESM, TypeScript compiled via `tsc` to `dist/`. Pi loads `dist/index.js` from each package — runtime needs the build, not source.
- Cross-package imports use named subpath exports (e.g., `@davidorex/pi-context/block-api`). pi-context declares explicit `exports` in `package.json`; unlisted subpaths are not importable.
- Tests: `tsx --test` for pi-context / pi-jit-agents / pi-workflows; `vitest` for pi-behavior-monitors
- Biome: tab indent, 120-char lines, scoped per `biome.json` (`packages/*/src/**` + `scripts/**`). `biome.json` declares `vcs.useIgnoreFile: true` so nested `.claude/worktrees/*` configs don't trigger nested-root errors
- Husky pre-commit runs `npm run check`, `npm test`, then the gate scripts: `check-changelog` (published-surface commits must grow `[Unreleased]`), `parity-check` (op↔CLI parity), and `check-config-schema` (non-additive config.schema.json diffs need a version advance + packaged config migration — expand-contract). Never `--no-verify`. Fix root cause + new commit on hook failure.
- GitHub Actions CI runs check + build + test on Node 22/23 for push/PR to main
- SKILL.md is generated build artifact (`npm run skills`) — do not edit by hand. Edit `skill-narrative.md` instead; uses YAML frontmatter + XML-tagged sections (no markdown headings).
- Lockstep versioning via `npm run release:*` invoking `scripts/bump-versions.js` (direct JSON read/write per package.json; never `npm version -ws` directly — fails 0.x minor/major bumps)
- **Op surface**: the reflecting `pi-context-cli` (`pi-context <op> …`) is the Claude Code-side shell surface over the op-registry — a substrate op is a library fn + a Pi tool the CLI reflects. The hand-written `scripts/orchestrator/*.ts` are composers (`compile-*-context.ts`, `inject-context-items.ts`), runtime-demos, and launch-support — hand-authored briefs forbidden, use these. `build-html-views.ts` projects the active substrate's `*.json` (via canonical pi-context block-api) to a self-contained HTML view at `html-views/substrate-overview.html`.
- Dispatch artifacts live under gitignored `compiled-contexts/` (orchestrator-composed agent input + agent-written reports). Project-root `tmp/` is also gitignored for ad-hoc scratch.
- The PreToolUse enforcement hooks in `.claude/hooks/` (e.g. the provenance/register guard, the pi-context direct-drive guard) are LIVE and fire repo-wide; they are not scoped to the active substrate (`FGAP-089`, unsolved). Develop/test changes to a guard against a COPY, never the live guard.

## Canonical implementation pipeline (every code change, including in-loop fixes)

The orchestration shape that wraps the Completion Sequence below. A feature AND every fix to a finding raised mid-pipeline flow through the same loop — a discovered divergence is not patched ad hoc, it re-enters the pipeline:

0. **Milestone gate (the `milestone-validity-gate` convention in `.context`, binding):** before a milestone's first task enters the pipeline, a fresh agent strictly validates ALL member filed text (anchors, mechanisms, cross-member coherence, testability, provenance) against current code, and findings are corrected via provenance-gated grants first.
1. **Implement — explore → plan → agent.** Enter plan mode; investigate *exclusively* via Explore agents (the orchestrator never greps as investigation); resolve the approach into a written plan; approve via ExitPlanMode; a foreground coding subagent implements from the approved plan. The orchestrator never hand-writes source. Pre-step: clean git baseline; file the resolved plan into the substrate (TASK/FGAP/DEC) — decomposing a feature into tasks per the canonical `feature-decomposition` convention in `.context` (composed verbatim into decomposition work; do not decompose ad hoc); set the task in-progress; branch off the porcelain-clean integration branch (per `feature-branch-workflow`).
2. **Verify — runtime demo + adversarial probe.** Real end-to-end invocation (not a mocked assertion) plus a fresh-context adversarial probe that independently re-derives. Tests-pass is necessary, not sufficient.
3. **Iterate to zero — every finding re-enters this same pipeline.** A divergence/defect surfaced by verify or the probe goes back through explore → plan → approve → agent, scoped to the finding's whole **class** (Explore enumerates the class; fix the class, not the one symptom).
4. **Re-verify the fix — fresh, non-inherited.** A fix does NOT inherit the prior green: re-run the runtime demo + a FRESH adversarial re-audit of the fix specifically. Loop 2→3→4 until a pass finds nothing new.
5. **Docs — check + sync the surface (the `docs-surface-sync` convention in `.context`, binding).** For any user-facing surface change: CHECK the package + monorepo READMEs for statements the change makes stale and correct them (audit, not only append); update the surfaced strings of any changed reflected op (`description`/`promptSnippet` in `ops-registry.ts`); update `skill-narrative.md` when the surface is a pi op; regen SKILL.md (`npm run skills`) when a skill source or op string changed. Usage-only — fix/defect/correction framing → CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`, never docs. **Brief-level enforcement:** every implementation brief for a surface change NAMES this audit explicitly (monorepo + relevant package README(s) + op strings + SKILL enumerated as the agent's deliverable); a brief without it is incomplete, and a probe that finds stale docs is an unconverged loop.
6. **Merge — `feature-branch-workflow`.** Merge to the integration branch; rebuild (pi loads `dist/`).
7. **Substrate closure — honest status.** Verification + `complete-task`; set the addressed feature to its TRUE bucket — `complete` only when its acceptance criteria are actually met, `in-review` when a credentialed/release-gated piece remains. Deferred/credentialed pieces are named, never faked. Delete the branch; `context-validate` clean.

Per-step detail (build/check/test, the probe's mutual-re-derivation rule, release, credentialed verification, publish) is the Completion Sequence below.

## Subagent dispatch fit (Claude Code only — not the in-pi agent surface)

Explore is a read-only search/trace agent — dispatch it ONLY for read/trace/enumerate work. Any task whose decisive step RUNS code or WRITES (a runtime experiment, a validated write, building or executing a fixture) goes to an executing (general-purpose) agent or the orchestrator runs it, never Explore. Every empirical step in a brief is a non-inferrable deliverable: demand the actual observed output and instruct "if blocked, STOP and report the blocker — never infer the result"; a reasoned-but-unrun conclusion is not a finding. The orchestrator independently re-runs or verifies the load-bearing empirical claim before relaying.

## Completion Sequence (mandatory after every code change)

Work is not complete until the runtime can load it. Pi loads from `dist/`, not source. Every code change follows the full sequence:

1. **Edit** source files
2. **Build**: `npm run build`
3. **Check**: `npm run check` (biome + tsc)
4. **Test**: `npm test` — full output inspection, no pipe-to-tail (pipe masks exit code)
5. **Runtime demonstration**: exercise the actual feature path end-to-end via real invocation (tsx eval against block-api / pi -p tool dispatch / direct CLI invocation against real substrate). NOT a mocked unit assertion. Tests-pass alone is insufficient.
6. **Adversarial verification probe**: fresh-context agent (or grep when sufficient) probes for false-pass scenarios. Probe verdict required before commit declared green. **Both the adversarial agent and the orchestrator's own probe can under-flag** — each constructs only the cases it thought of, so neither alone is sufficient: the orchestrator independently re-verifies the audit's load-bearing claims (don't relay a verdict), and the audit independently re-derives the orchestrator's. When either finds a defect, fixing it does NOT inherit the prior green — **a fix to any audit/probe finding requires a FRESH re-audit of the fix** (a CRITICAL especially), because the fix can introduce its own defect or close only the reported instance of a class. Loop fix→re-verify→re-audit until a pass finds nothing new.
7. **Docs + Skills (the `docs-surface-sync` convention, binding)**: for any user-facing surface change, CHECK BOTH the package README (`packages/<pkg>/README.md`) AND the monorepo root `README.md` for statements the change makes stale and correct them — audit, not only append; update the surfaced strings of any changed reflected op (`description`/`promptSnippet` in `ops-registry.ts`); update the SKILL source `skill-narrative.md` when the surface is a pi op — all **usage-only** (what the surface does + how to use it; never what it fixes — fix/defect/correction framing lives ONLY in `CHANGELOG.md`). Then `npm run skills` (regen SKILL.md when a skill source or op string changed; never hand-edit SKILL.md). The CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` entry is separately required + gate-enforced (`check-changelog`).
8. **Commit**: forensic message per global CLAUDE.md guidelines
9. **Status cascade**: the Claude Code Task tool + the active substrate's own status blocks (via block-api)
10. **Merge to main**: if on a feature branch
11. **Release**: `npm run release:patch|minor|major` based on commit type
12. **Credentialed verification (pre-publish for arc-completion releases)**: run the canonical verification protocol at `docs/reports/pi-internal-verification-protocol-2026-07-05.md` (or its dated successor — always the newest dated protocol in `docs/reports/`; each gate run appends its executed record or writes a new dated successor when the surface has moved) when the release ships new public surface; uses pi's `auth.json` directly (no separate env-var gate). Routine bumps don't require this — build/check/test catches breakage there.
13. **Publish**: requires interactive `npm login` + OTP — user action

Steps 1-10 are the agent's responsibility. Step 12 applies to arc-completion releases only. Step 13 requires user action. Declaring work "done" before step 10 is a failure.

**Steps 5+6 are LOAD-BEARING**: every implementation step requires runtime demo + adversarial probe. Tests-pass is necessary, not sufficient — LLMs perform; tests pass for the wrong reason (side-effect masks feature; assertion no longer tests what it claims; import silently no-ops; fallback swallows failure).

## Do Not Touch

- **`.pi/`**: user's runtime testing directory. Never create / modify / delete files there.
- **`docs/`**: gitignored planning docs. Read-only reference.

## Experience-Gap Handling (mandatory)

An experience gap — any defect, inconsistency, or gap surfaced through *using* the tooling (CLI / op / script / workflow dogfooding), as distinct from one found by reading code — must be tasked to an agent to determine root cause and shape, provide intel, and establish reproducible conditions. The agent's root-cause + shape + reproducible conditions are the basis for filing the gap (FGAP). Do not file an experience gap, or act on it, from ad-hoc self-investigation.

**Explore before file (prior-art search is a precondition of EVERY filing).** Before filing any FGAP / TASK / DECISION / research item, the investigating agent MUST search the substrate for an existing item already covering it and report the coverage — id + status + any planned task addressing it. If it is already tracked, do NOT refile: relate to / inform the existing item (`research_informs_item`, an edge, or refinement intel against its `proposed_resolution`) and report it, rather than creating a duplicate. A new filing is justified only once the search confirms the substrate does not already track it. This binds every new substrate item, not only experience gaps: item counts only grow, so unguarded filing is where duplicates accumulate. The agent's investigation brief therefore includes "does the substrate already track this?" alongside root-cause / shape / repro.

**De-ephemeralize at the source (the `de-ephemeralize-at-source` convention, binding).** Intel and context are captured durably by the agent that produces them, at the moment of production — never left as transient agent output for the orchestrator to re-render to file (signal loss). An investigating/exploring agent WRITES ITS OWN report (`analysis/<date>-<slug>.md`) as part of its task; a gap-exploring agent writes the investigation file AND, when the investigation is research-grade, files the rhetorical-register-compliant research item itself (`findings_document` → its md). The agent's return is a pointer + verdict, not the content. The orchestrator verifies and commits — it does not author the artifact from the agent's summary. A brief for investigation work that lacks the write-your-own-report instruction is incomplete.

**Surface the gap's class (the `gap-explore-surfaces-class` convention, binding).** Every gap exploration MUST identify and surface whether the specific gap is an INSTANCE of a more general class, and if so characterize that class and file at the level the class warrants — the general gap with the specific symptom as its triggering instance, not the narrow symptom alone. This generalizes the iterate-to-zero "fix the class, not the one symptom" rule UP to gap identification: the gap itself may be a narrow instance of a broader gap. The agent's investigation brief therefore includes "is this a class of a more general thing?" alongside root-cause / shape / repro / prior-art; if the gap is genuinely atomic, the agent states that conclusion with reasoning (surfacing is mandatory; generalization is not assumed). Filing the symptom leaves the class as architectural debt and invites duplicate sibling filings.

## Analysis-MD → Research block (heuristic)

After writing an analysis markdown (`analysis/*.md`), propose to the user surfacing it into the `research` block — a research item whose `findings_document` points at the md, adding the queryable layer a bare md lacks: `findings_summary` (prompt-injectable), `grounding`, `stale_conditions`, `citations`. The user decides whether it surfaces. Not every analysis MD is research: grounded investigations / feasibility / comparisons / audits / landscapes are candidates; plans, execution-ledgers, specs, cycle/verification reports, issue inventories, roadmaps, decision-frames, and scratch are not (they belong to tasks / decisions / nowhere). Propose; do not auto-file.

## Workflow SDK

`packages/pi-workflows/src/workflow-sdk.ts` is the single queryable surface (vocabulary / discovery / contracts / introspection / validation), all derived from code + filesystem. Read its `src/index.ts` exports for the function set; use `/workflow status` for derived state in conversation.

## Context SDK

`packages/pi-context/src/context-sdk.ts` is the single queryable surface for project state, block discovery, schema vocabulary, and cross-block validation (it re-exports the lens-view / closure-table / PM-lens / write / schema-write / migration / dir-resolution / execution-context primitives). Read its `src/index.ts` exports for the function set; use `/context status` for derived state in conversation.

## Project Blocks (the active substrate)

**The active substrate IS the project-management system (binding):** all development work — milestones, phases, tasks, gaps, issues, decisions, verifications, and their relations — is planned, tracked, and closed in `.context`, not in side documents or memory, and project state / position / open work are derived from it. This PM model is itself being refined through use: its block kinds, fields, status vocabularies, and relations evolve as the work exercises them, and that refinement is filed in the substrate (as gaps and decisions), not assumed fixed.

**Intended audience + use of all `.context` filings (binding):** the entire `.context` substrate, and every individual filing in it, exists to be a DRY context that is composed VERBATIM into subagent contexts. Filings are not notes-to-self or human-only prose — they are the source text that gets handed, unaltered, to subagents as their operating context. Whoever files (item bodies, decision/issue/gap/task field text, acceptance criteria, scope statements, ID ranges, relation content, etc.) MUST file with that audience and use in mind: each field must be self-sufficient, precise, and correct as the literal instruction a downstream subagent will act on. Garbage in = garbage out to subagents. Do not paraphrase or restate a filing when briefing — pass the filed text verbatim; correspondingly, file text that is fit to be passed verbatim.

**Rhetorical situation for every block write (binding):** Write every block for its consumers and its purpose, no more and no less. Write terse, signal-dense, self-contained entries exactingly appropriate for the block type and for its use downstream. Blocks are state and context atoms designed to be consumed downstream, not prose addressed to a general audience.

**Filing provenance (the `filing-provenance` convention, binding):** every semantic element of a planning-block filing carries one of three provenances — user-VERBATIM, user-DIRECTED, or DERIVABLE from a cited fact/convention/decision; anything else is augmentation and does not go in. A qualifier that narrows what the user said (a mode, an opt-in, a flag, a tier, a deferral) is never derivable — it is a cited user decision or absent. An item bound to user stories is DIFFED against the stories' verbatim statements at filing, and every explore/plan/probe brief for a story-bound item includes that verbatim-delta check ("any delta is a filing defect to surface, not a requirement to implement"). The planning-block write guard STOPS every such write: the model ends its turn presenting the USER a per-element provenance table (element → class → evidence), and files only after the user grants permission — the `# provenance-reviewed` sentinel attests the USER's granted permission for that payload, never self-review. Filings are composed verbatim downstream — an augmentation at filing becomes the requirement everywhere it is consumed.

Typed JSON files with schemas. Substrate writes via block-api primitives (validated + DispatchContext-stamped). Direct `Edit` / `Write` on the active substrate's `*.json` is forbidden. `pi -p "call append-block-item"` is retired; do not use.

**Canonical filing patterns** — via the globally-installed reflecting CLI (`pi-context <op>`), one write per Bash call, `--writer '{"kind":"human","user":"davidryan@gmail.com"}' --json`:

- **Append** (new item): write JSON to `/tmp/<id>.json`, then `append-block-item --block <name> --arrayKey <key> --autoId true --item @/tmp/<id>.json --writer … --json`. Use `read-schema --schemaName <name> --path properties.<key>.items.required` first when unfamiliar with the block's fields; `--arrayKey` is the block's `array_key` (`read-config --registry block_kinds --id <name>`). Birth edges (forcing-artifact / convention / decomposition links a new item must carry) go on the SAME call via `--relations '[{"relation_type":"…","direction":"as_parent|as_child","other":"<id>"}]'` (`direction` = the endpoint the NEW item occupies) — the item + its edges are one gate-judged atom; on an error-severity birth-edge invariant a bare filing is refused and the edge cannot be appended afterward.
- **Status mutation / field update**: `update-block-item --block <name> --arrayKey <key> --match '{"id":"…"}' --updates '{…}' --writer …`.
- **Edges** (between EXISTING items): `append-relation` / `append-relations`. **Task closure** (2 ops): file a `verification` item (`append-block-item`, with any birth `--relations` it needs) + `complete-task --taskId … --verificationId …` — complete-task files the `verification_verifies_item` edge itself (idempotent) and flips status in one atom; no standalone `append-relation` step (that sequence is refused by the error-severity closure invariants). **Integrity**: `context-validate` after relation writes.
- `--item`/`--updates` `@file` for apostrophe/newline-heavy payloads; verify every write by reading back (`read-block-item` / `read-block-page`). (Library functions with no CLI op still go via `npx tsx -e`; substrate switching has one — `context-switch` — so never raw-flip via `flipBootstrapPointer`.)

**Install ceremony** (per `/context init`). The canonical catalog is the packaged conception `packages/pi-context/samples/conception.json`; legacy `registry/`+`defaults/` are unshipped on-disk test fixtures only:
- `/context init <dir>` — bootstrap `.pi-context.json` pointer + substrate/schemas dirs only (no config, no defaults)
- `/context accept-all` — adopt `samples/conception.json` as `config.json` (full vocabulary + `installed_*`, root-overridden, idempotent never-clobber); writes config only
- `/context install` — copies declared `installed_schemas[]`/`installed_blocks[]` from the samples catalog (`samples/schemas/` + `samples/blocks/`), base-stamping each as-installed schema body into `objects/` + recording the install baseline (schemas only)
- `/context update [--dryRun]` — brings the installed schema model current with the catalog (supersedes `install --update`): `in-sync` no-op; `catalog-ahead` resync (migration-aware); `locally-modified`/`both-diverged` reconciled by a deterministic 3-way merge (base = object-store body at the baseline `content_hash`, ours = installed, theirs = catalog) that auto-merges disjoint edits; irreconcilable conflicts route to a `pi-bound` mergetool (TTY) or a read-only report. `--dryRun` previews, writes nothing
- Or hand-author `config.json`'s `installed_*` then `/context install`

**Block kinds**: query the samples catalog via the `read-samples-catalog` tool (or read `samples/conception.json` `block_kinds[]`) for the canonical set + descriptions. Each schema declares its array_key + required fields + ID pattern.

**Closure-table relations**: the active substrate's `relations.json` carries edges `{ parent, child, relation_type, ordinal? }` for ALL inter-item relationships. Per-edge `relation_type` registered in `config.relation_types[]`. FK-as-field on item schemas is forbidden.

**Schema versioning** ($id + version + $ref + migration registry): per-schema evolution; `validateBlockWithMigration` runs migrations when block file's `schema_version` differs from current.

## Key Architecture

Load-bearing architectural rules (not change-history):

- Each workflow step runs as a subprocess (`pi --mode json`) with its own context window. Main conversation is control plane; workflows are subordinate.
- Agent specs are `.agent.yaml` only (no `.md` fallback). Compiled to prompts via Nunjucks at dispatch time. Specs declare `inputSchema` (validated pre-spawn), `contextBlocks` (block names injected as `_<name>` into template context with framework anti-injection delimiters), `output.format`/`output.schema` (validated post-completion).
- `templates/shared/macros.md` provides one rendering macro per block kind. Agents import via `{% from "shared/macros.md" import render_<kind> %}`. Three-tier template search: project `.pi/templates/` > user `~/.pi/agent/monitors/` > package `examples/`.
- Monitor specs are `.monitor.json` with required `classify.agent` → `.agent.yaml` spec. Classify enforces structured output via the phantom tool pattern: forced `toolChoice` on a `VERDICT_TOOL` whose params match `verdict.schema.json` (CLEAN/FLAG/NEW). Forced-toolChoice shape is provider-specific; route through `normalizeToolChoice(api, toolName)` from `@davidorex/pi-jit-agents` — no hardcoded toolChoice shapes at consumer call sites. Forced tool-use unenforceable on `openai-responses` family + google providers.
- Monitor step type: workflows invoke monitors as verification gates via `monitor: <name>`. CLEAN → completed; FLAG/NEW → failed.
- `block:<name>` schema references resolve to `<contextDir>/schemas/<name>.schema.json` per the resolver — portable across substrate-dir names.
- State persisted atomically (tmp + rename) after each step. State write failure is fatal.
- Block artifact writes are fatal — schema-validation failure on an active-substrate `*.json` artifact fails the workflow. Non-block artifacts remain non-fatal. On resume, all steps are preserved; only artifact processing re-runs.
- Agent step JSON output validation is fatal — declared `output.format: json` or `output.schema` must be honored; markdown-fenced JSON fails.
- Agent step `context: string[]` inlines prior step `textOutput` into dispatch prompt as labeled markdown sections.
- Agent output instructions tell agents: "raw JSON only, no markdown fences." File-write is secondary; most JSON-producing agents lack write tools — textOutput is the only output channel.
- `invokeMonitor(name, context?)` export from pi-behavior-monitors enables programmatic classification without `activate()` side effects.
- DispatchContext attestation: every block-api write accepts optional `ctx?: DispatchContext` with `WriterIdentity` (kinds: human / agent / monitor / workflow). When provided AND the target schema declares author fields, items are stamped per the schema's declared subset (per-field declaration honored; upsert pre-merge preserves attestation across replacement updates).

## pi-context-cli — direct-drive discipline (dogfooding)

The globally-installed `pi-context` command (`pi-context <op> --flag value …`) is the dogfooding surface for substrate reads and writes — drive the real global command **directly** (not `node …/dist/bin.js`), one clean invocation per operation, inline flags. `--item @/tmp/<id>.json` only when the payload's quotes/apostrophes fight the shell. Verify every write through the CLI's own read op (`read-block-item` / `read-block`) — output landing ≠ success.

Forbidden:
- **Bypassing the CLI to inspect or mutate substrate/schema state by other means** — `node -e "require('./.context/*.json')"`, `cat`, `Read`/`Edit` on the active substrate's `*.json` or `schemas/*.json`. If a CLI op reads it, read it through the op.
- **Wrapping the CLI in shell glue to substitute for or post-process it** — `for`-loops over fields, `| head`/`| tail`, `2>/dev/null`, tsx-eval re-parsing of its output. One op call answers one question; read the whole node, not field-by-field.

Friction hit while driving the CLI is an experience gap — file it (Experience-Gap Handling), never route around it.

## CLI Access from Other Agents

Pi tools accessible from any LLM with shell access via `pi -p "prompt" --mode json`. Subprocess loads all extensions, executes tool calls, returns newline-delimited JSON events. Same mechanism the workflow executor uses for step dispatch.

**Cost-control discipline**: always pin a fast non-agentic model + restrict tool surface unless write is required:

```bash
pi -p "..." --mode json --tools read --no-skills --model openrouter/anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5
```

For write tools, restrict to minimum (`--tools read,write` or omit `--tools` if prompt needs broader access); always retain `--model` pin. Wrap long invocations in `gtimeout 120 pi -p ...`.

To enumerate available tools at any time: query `/workflow status` + `/context status` or grep `pi.registerTool` across `packages/*/src/`.

## Substrate authorship semantics

All substrate content — block items, schemas, analysis MDs, commit bodies, plan files, decompositions, acceptance criteria, ID ranges, sub-phase numbering, relation_type names, FGAP/DEC/TASK field text, etc. — is LLM-authored unless verbatim quoted from a user message. User authorization operates at the directive level (verbatim instructions to file / proceed / decide); the LLM composes content under that authorization.

Filed substrate carries user filing-authority. It is the **working baseline** — reviewable against verbatim user-message direction at the point of action when re-anchoring matters, never invalidated wholesale. Do NOT pole-swing between treating filed content as "canonical-unquestionable" and "fabricated-untrustworthy". Steady state: working baseline + targeted review at the action point.

When archaeology (e.g. `claude-history` queries) distinguishes verbatim-user-directed content from LLM-composed-under-filing-authority content, report the distinction as targeted-review information for the user to anchor specific elements, not as baseline-discard. Never introduce authorship-archaeology unprompted in routine work; surface it when explicitly asked or when an action genuinely requires re-anchoring.
