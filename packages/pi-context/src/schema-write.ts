/**
 * Canonical schema-write surface — read / write / mutate the JSON Schemas
 * that live alongside project blocks under `<projectRoot>/schemas/`.
 *
 * Closes structurally:
 *   - FGAP-011 (canonical schema-write surface): every schema mutation that
 *     would otherwise reach `.project/schemas/*.schema.json` via direct fs
 *     edits now has a single typed entry point. Direct fs writes remain
 *     possible but are now a parallel ungated path that should be retired
 *     in any future schema mutation per the F-006-bypass-pattern discipline.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - All schemas pass through AJV draft-07 meta-schema validation before
 *     they touch disk. Malformed schemas throw `ValidationError` with the
 *     meta-violation details; the file is not created or modified.
 *   - Atomic on-disk semantics — writes go to a `<file>.schema-write-<pid>.tmp`
 *     sibling and are renamed into place. A failed write leaves the prior
 *     schema byte-identical.
 *   - Schema files land at `<projectRoot>/schemas/<schemaName>.schema.json`
 *     where `projectRoot` honors `config.root` per the bootstrap-aware
 *     resolver in `project-context.ts`.
 *
 * Out-of-scope for step 3:
 *   - Schema $id + version + $ref + migration registry (FGAP-006, step 4)
 *   - Schema diff / change-log tooling
 *   - Cross-package opinionated mutators (e.g. add-author-fields shorthand)

/**
 * Op-correct create-or-replace of a whole schema body, layered over
 * `writeSchema` (FGAP-077 — the Pi-tool / CLI-facing schema-write op).
 *
 * Where `writeSchema` is an unconditional create-or-overwrite, this surface
 * adds an explicit operation discriminator so a caller's intent (create a NEW
 * schema vs. replace an EXISTING one) is enforced rather than silently
 * coerced:
 *   - `operation: "create"` requires the schema to be ABSENT — a collision
 *     with an existing schema throws (use `replace` to overwrite).
 *   - `operation: "replace"` requires the schema to be PRESENT — a missing
 *     target throws (use `create` to initialize).
 *   - any other operation string throws before any disk read.
 *
 * The presence check reuses `readSchema` (returns `null` when absent) and the
 * single private `schemaWritePath` helper so there is one path source. The
 * actual write delegates to `writeSchema`, which meta-validates against the
 * draft-07 meta-schema and writes atomically (tmp + rename); this surface adds
 * no second validation or write path.
 *
 * Migration boundary (DECIDED, FGAP-077): this op writes the schema JSON and
 * meta-validates the schema body. It does NOT migrate existing block items
 * forward when a `replace` changes the schema's `version`. A breaking
 * evolution is handled at READ time by `validateBlockWithMigration`, which
 * throws a version mismatch until a code-level `MigrationFn` is registered via
 * `createRegistry().register(...)` — and there is no Pi-tool surface for
 * registering a `MigrationFn`. This surface does not (and must not) emit an
 * "items exist at old version" warning: that would require reading block files
 * to assess data-layer impact from inside the schema-write layer, inverting
 * the read-time / write-time layering.
 *
 * `ctx` is accepted and IGNORED: schema files carry no author-attestation
 * fields, so there is nothing to stamp. The parameter is present for call-site
 * parity with the attestation-aware block-write / config-write surfaces
 * (mirrors `amendConfigEntry`'s ctx-forwarding parameter, which forwards to
 * `writeConfig`; here there is no author-bearing target to forward to).
 *
 * `opts.dryRun` runs the SAME meta-validator `writeSchema` uses against the
 * supplied body and returns `{ written: false }` without touching disk —
 * keeping ONE validation path (no re-implemented validation for the preview).
